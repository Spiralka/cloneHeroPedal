# Guitar Effects Pedal for Clone Hero

## The problem 

I got a Guitar Hero bundle for the Nintendo Wii, and connected the guitar controller to the PC using [this](https://santroller.tangentmc.net/wiring_guides/wii.html) guide to create an adapter. But there is a problem - everything works well, except one thing: it is very difficult to press the "Star Power" button on the guitar/keyboard. I could have soldered several components to activate this via tilt, but it was not convenient for me. That's why I decided to create a guitar effect pedal to press "Star Power" with my foot.

And one more reason: I got my first 3D printer and I really wanted to create my first "Hello World" 3D model and print it out!

## What do you need?

- Arduino Micro (Don't use the Nano version, as it doesn't have the HID)
- Few wires
- Button for guitar pedal (Foot Switch)
- Some soldering skills
- 3D printer (or a service for 3D printing)

## Software part

- [Install](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/starting-guide/getting-started-arduino/) Arduino IDE and drivers 
- Clone and open cloneHeroSketch.ino
- Open "Librari manager" tab
- Search and download "Keyboard" by Arduino
- In the upper-left corner select the model of your board
- Connect Arduino
- Press Upload

## Hardware part

- Download 3D models from 3D Models folder
- Print it out!
- Solder the wires according to the scheme
- Assemble everything
- Enjoi
